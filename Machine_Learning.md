### Types of Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence, mainly systems that can learn from data.  Types can be a combination of:
* __supervised__ or __unsupervised__
    - _supervised_ means to make predictions, create generalizations from labeled training data. 
    - _unsupervised_ means to extract hidden structure from unlabeled data.  Examples include clustering, Markov models, dimension reduction
* __categorical (aka qualitative)__ or __continuous (aka quantitative)__
    - 

* __supervised __ -
